# Master thesis: Mapping Flood Inundation Using Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 Data and the Google Earth Engine Cloud Processing Platform
Here I present the following methods applied to my master thesis.
This project provied a set of JavaScript methods for detectig floods using S1 SAR and S2 optical images. 
The methods use change detection and thresholding techniques to idntify areas of the image that have been flooded. 
The project includes sample data and instructions for how to use the methods. 

The methods were done on Google Earth Engine. 
To apply the methods on the website, you will need a Google Earth Engine user and licence. 
You can create a Google Earth Engine account by following the instructions on the Google Earth Engine website (https://earthengine.google.com/).
